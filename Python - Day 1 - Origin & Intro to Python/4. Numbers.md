# Printing Numbers ðŸ“š 

When we want to program using ``numbers``, we do not need to use quotation marks `" "`.

One thing Python understands outside quotation marks are numbers. 

Python recognises when numbers are being used for calculations, instead of strings.

We can use Python to do **_Math calculations_** and carry out all types of equations.

## Task 5 - Numbers ðŸ”¢

- Before you type the following code into `main.py`, turn to your classmate and **_PREDICT_** what will be printed to the console?
- Then type it up, click **_RUN_**, and see what your output is.

````py
print(5)
print(3+6)
print(144/12)
print(10*2)
print("Answer = 50")
print("Answer =", 50)
````

### Questions to make you think ðŸ¤” 
- Were your predictions correct?
- What happens in the last code example?
- Replace `50` with `50-10` in each of the last two examples and try to explain the results.
