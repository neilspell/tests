# The print( ) function 📚

Today we are going to learn about some of the basic things we can do with Python.

The first one is writing a message to the console using the `print()` function.

## Task 1 - Hello, World!
This is the classic first program in any language. 

It's the first line of code most programmers create when they learn a new language...**_Hello, World!_**

In `main.py` underneath where it says Task 1, I want you to type the following code:

````py
print("Hello, World!")
````

Then click the green RUN button at the top of your screen to see what happens.

## Task 2 - Errors and Bugs🪲
Let's try to make an error on purpose...

- Type print with a capital "P".
````py
Print("Goodbye you guys.")
````

What happens? Can you guess why?

## Now try the following:

- Try adding a space after the `print` and before the `(`.
- Try to use single quotation marks `' '` instead of double quotes `" "`.
- Do these cause errors or not?

### 📝Note:
There are 2 types of errors, `syntax` and `logic` errors.

1. `syntax` errors are spelling mistakes, punctuation, capitalisation of letters. This will stop your code from running properly.

2. `logic` errors can happen when the **_syntax_** is correct amd the program runs, but the output is not as expected. (e.g. you may have forgotten a  line of code, or put the instructions in the wrong order)

These types of logic errors are called bugs. 🪲
They can sometimes be hard to find, as you won't get help from the computer with an error message.


## Task 3 - Greeting 👨🏽‍💻
Using the skills you have just learned, see if you can write a program to greet yourself (the User).

Sample Output:

````
Greetings Human, welcome to Python Programming!

How are you?
````
