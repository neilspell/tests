# Comments ðŸ“š

Python comments are like **_sticky notes_** for your code.

````py
# This is a comment
````

Imagine you're reading a book, and you want to jot down some notes or thoughts in the margins. 

``Comments`` in Python are a bit like those notes. 

- They are messages you write in your code for yourself or others to understand what's going on.
- But here's the cool part: when the computer runs your code, it ignores these comments completely.
- They're just there to help people understand the code better.

In Python, you make ``comments`` using the ``#`` symbol.

Whenever you put a ``#`` in your code, everything after it on that line is treated as a comment.


## Task 6 - Comments

Type the following code into `main.py` and see what happens.

````py
# This is a comment. The computer will ignore it.
print("Hello, World!")  # This is another comment.
````

### ðŸ¤”Question:
- So why are `# comments` useful??

### ðŸ’¡Answer:
- You can use comments to explain what your code does. This is super helpful for you and others who might want to read your code later.



## Task 7 - Adding Comments
Type the following code into `main.py`, then edit the comments to explain what each piece of code does.


````py
# Explain what this piece of code does:
print(3+6)

# Explain what this piece of code does:
print("Monty Python\nand The Holy Grail")

# Explain what this piece of code does:
name = "SpongeBob"
print("Hello", name, "would you like a Crabby Patty?")

# Explain what this piece of code does:
'''' 
This is kind of 
a trick question
can you figure it out?
