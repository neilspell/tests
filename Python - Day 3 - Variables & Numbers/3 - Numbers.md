# Numbers and CalculationsðŸ”¢

Python can do basic math operations.

Let's take two numbers and store them in the variables `x` and `y`.

```python
x = 10
y = 5
````
- The lines of code shown below are all _JUMBLED UP_.

- Try to arrange the code so that you can perform the correct calculations and get the correct answer.

````py
print("Sum:",)
print("Difference:",)
print(product_result)
print(quotient_result)

sum_result = 
difference_result = 
product_result = 
quotient_result = 

x - y
x / y
x + y
x * y

# Remember to add comments to explain what your code is doing.

This type of jumbled up code question is called a **_Parson's Problem!_**
