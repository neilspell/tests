# Input Command 📚
The `input` command allows a user to enter a value into a running program and have that value stored in a variable.

Let's see if we can improve upon the previous program and make it more dynamic.

> Type the following into ``main.py``and run it to see what output you will get.

````python
# Input command
personName = input("Enter your name: ")
favouriteColour = input("Enter your favourite colour: ")
print("Hi", personName, "- your favourite colour is", favouriteColour)
print("Goodbye", personName)
````
