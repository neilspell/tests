## 5 - Play Again 👨🏽‍💻
   - After completing a challenge, you might have noticed by now that our game just stops.
   - This is a poor feature and doesn't look good.
   - Let's asks the user if they want to play again.
   - If the user chooses "yes", the game restarts; otherwise, it ends.

Can you remember how to do this? 

> Remember we added this feature to our _Rock Paper Scissors_ game last week.

> Use the _👀 Hint_ below if you're stuck.

## 6 - Comments
Please remember to add `# comments` to your code to explain what different sectiosn are doing.
