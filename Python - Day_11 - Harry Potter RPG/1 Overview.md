## What's involved 🕵🏽‍♂️📝
The key components we will use to build our game are: 
- `while`loops.
- Conditional statements `if`, `elif`, `else`.
- User inputs `input`.
- ASCII art.



## 1 - Welcome Screen & Menu 🖥️
Create a welcome screen and menu selction for our user.

You should try to displays a welcome message and set the scene at Hogwarts.
Using the skills you have aquired over the last few weeks, see if you can recreate the following display in the console:

````
Welcome to the Magical Adventure!

You find yourself at the entrance of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
As you step inside, you encounter three different corridors.
Each corridor leads to a different magical challenge.

## 2 - Time Delay ⌛
