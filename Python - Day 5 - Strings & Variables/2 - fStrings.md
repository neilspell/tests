# Using fStrings 📚

`fStrings` are a convenient way to format strings in Python, introduced in Python 3.6. 

They are concise and readable. 

Here are three simple exercises to help explain `fStrings` and their syntax.

### Part A 👨🏽‍💻
- Create two variables to store two different words.
- Combine the two words into a new variable using string concatenation.
- Print out the concatenated string using an `fString`.

 ```python
 # Create variables
 word1 = "Hello"
 word2 = "World"

 # Combine words using string concatenation
 combined_string = f"{word1} {word2}!"

 # Print message
 print()
 ```


### Part B 👨🏽‍💻
- Create two variables `name` and `age`.
- Use them inside an ``fString`` to create a formatted message as shown below.

````
Hello Alice, you are 13 years old.
````

### Part C 👨🏽‍💻
- Create two variables `num1` and `num2`.
- Calculate the sum and product of both the numbers, using arithmetic operations on them.
  - i.e.  `sum_result` and `product_result`.
- Use ``fStrings`` to insert the results of arithmetic operations directly into a string.

````py
# Part C

# Declare variables
num1 = 


# Perform arithmetic operations
sum_result = 
product_result =

# Create an f-string with the results & print the message.
print(f"")

````



### Part D 👨🏽‍💻
- Prompt the user to enter their `name` and favourite food `favFood`.
- Using `fStrings` create a personalised message using the inputs provided.

````py
# Part D

# Get user input
name = input()
favFood = 

# Create an f-string using user input & print a personalised message.



````
- Modify the inputs to request some more information from the user.
- Display the new message in the console.
