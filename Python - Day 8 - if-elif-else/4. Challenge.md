# Challenge ⚔️

## Age Classifier

1. Create a Python program that takes the user's ``age`` as an input.
2. Based on the age, provide a response in one of the four categories:
   - "Kids,"
   - "Teenagers,"
   - "Adults,"
   - "Old people."
4. Make the responses _funny_ or _interesting_ to engage the user.
